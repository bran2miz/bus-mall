Comments:
This assignment was pretty difficult! Although the lecture did in fact help out, I still needed assistance from the TA. What made this more challenging was creating the personal token in order for the pictures to appear. I felt like that was the most challenging.

Although I found it extremely difficult, through the help of my classmates, I was able to finish this assignment in less than 5 hours. I definitely felt that this assignment would exceeding that by double, considering how arduous creating the token was.
